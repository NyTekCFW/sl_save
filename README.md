# sl_save
A proof of concept (PoC) demonstrating the feasibility of incorporating a save functionality into the "So_Long" project of 42 school with a "xor encryption" (low level)

## Install
```bash
git clone git@github.com:NyTekCFW/sl_save.git
```
## Build
```bash
make or make re
```
## Use
```bash
./sl_save make saves/player_1.bin
./sl_save read saves/player_1.bin
```
## Warning
```
This software is just an example of how u can implement a little save system (with a low level of encryption).
The project respect the 42 norms + all functions are allowed on the subject.
U can add a function to check if the settings is correctly exported and imported, i removed my tester (#sad).
This method is not the best but, in fact, u dont need more advanced features for this project.
